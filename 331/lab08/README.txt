Task 1 - Bouncing Ball:
a) Implement a MIPS program that displays a bright pixel moving left and right on screen using the SetColumn subroutine from the file Lab8_DisplayLibrary.asm.
b) How many instructions does your program need for one iteration of the pixel moving from the right to the left and back to the right.
c) Implement a MIPS program that has the following 4x4bit pattern (ball) move left and right:
	0110
	1001
	1001
	0110
d) Implement a MIPS program that displays a bright pixel moving left and right on screen. Have the pixel move at an angle. Start the pixel movement where each 3 steps to the left the pixel also moves up one row. When the pixel hits a side of the screen, it should be reflected from that side, i.e. movement parallel to the side continues in the same direction, movement vertical to the side changes direction.
e) Implement a MIPS program that moves the pattern (ball) from c) according to the directions in d).
