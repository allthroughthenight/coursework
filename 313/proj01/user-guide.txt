1. Introdution

You wake up in a large house. Your breathing echos hauntingly through the great
hall. As you get familiar with your surroundings, a constant moaning can be
heard all around. You see a zombie shambling around, but you're unsure what to
do. You see a few items lying around and other locations. You might not know
how you got here, but you'll find your way out for sure. You cant defeat
zombies with mortal weapons. You need to summon the super wizard to destory all
of them. Remember that actions need an object and subject.
